# Online Fraud Detection

## Project Description
This project focuses on detecting fraudulent transactions in online platforms. The goal is to classify transactions as **fraudulent** or **legitimate** using machine learning techniques.

## Dataset
- Source: [C:\Users\Saniya Firdose\OneDrive\Desktop\face recognization\dataset]
- Description: Dataset contains transaction details such as transaction amount, type, timestamp, and other relevant features.

## Features
- List of important features used in the model:
  - `Transaction Amount`
  - `Transaction Type`
  - `Account Age`
  - `Previous Transaction Count`
  - `...`

## Methods / Models Used
- **Preprocessing:** Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, scaling numeric features
- **Models:** Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC

## Installation
Clone the repository and install dependencies:

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd Online-Fraud-Detection
pip install -r requirements.txt


Usage
Run the main script to execute the workflow:

python main.py
Or open the Jupyter notebook (if applicable):
jupyter notebook notebook.ipynb
